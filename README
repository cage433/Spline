A utility for generating basis surfaces

1. Building the app

This app is built using SBT, the scala simple build tool http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/. It is included in this project.

To build, simply cd to the Spline directory, then 

    $ java -jar sbt-launch-0.7.4.jar

This will give you a command line prompt, simply enter 

    > test

This will compile the code and its test classes and run the tests.

2. Installing the xlloop addin

To run the Excel example, excel needs an add-in called xlloop, which allows external functions
to be called in several languages. This has already been added to Excel in the virtual machine
you gave me access to. If you need to run the example on another machine simply install the add-in

    Spline/xlloop/bin/xlloop-0.3.1.xll

From Excel it's simply Big Button on the Top Left -> Excel Options -> Add Ins (Sorry if that's teaching you to suck eggs)


3. Launching the server

In order for Excel to call the code a server needs to be launched. From the command line (in windows)

    $ java -cp lib\*;target\scala_2.8.0\classes kalahari.ExcelBridge

or from Cygwin

    $ java -cp `cygpath lib/*:target/scala_2.8.0/classes` kalahari.ExcelBridge


4. Running the spreadsheet - 

Simply open the spreadsheet InterpolationExamples.xlsx - play with the numbers in yellow and hit F9

And that's it
